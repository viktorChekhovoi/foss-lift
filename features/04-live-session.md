# Live workout session

Start a day, log each set, run the rest timer, and finish — all in memory until
you're done.

## What it does

- **Starts a training day** and hydrates set rows from the template.
- **Logs sets by tapping.** Each row shows a goal (reps or seconds) and a weight;
  tapping cycles the logged value, and you can edit weight/reps directly.
- **Tracks duration and set count live** — a 1-second timer ticks the elapsed
  time; the set counter updates as you log.
- **Runs a rest timer** using each slot's configured rest, with
  shorter / longer / skip controls.
- **Suggests warm-up sets** for barbell/weighted lifts — an ascending ramp toward
  the working weight — kept separate from the working sets.
- **Survives being collapsed** — leave the session and a "Resume workout" pill
  floats over every other screen.
- **On Finish**, writes only the completed sets, advances progression, and opens
  the [post-session recap](10-history-and-stats.md).

## How to use it

- **Start:** Today → tap a day → **Start workout**. (If a [layoff
  deload](06-layoff-deloads.md) is offered, accept or decline it here first.)
- **Log a set:** tap the set row to cycle its value (goal → one fewer → … → 0 →
  untouched); type a different weight or rep count to override.
- **Rest:** logging a set starts the rest banner; use shorter / longer / skip.
- **Warm-ups:** expand the collapsed warm-up group above the working sets; adjust
  the number of warm-up sets with its stepper.
- **Leave and come back:** the down-arrow collapses the session (it keeps
  running); tap the **Resume workout** pill to return.
- **Finish:** tap Finish → the recap screen appears.

## Behaviour & edge cases

- **The live session is in memory** and only writes to the DB on Finish, so
  editing sets is instant and a mid-session crash can't leave half-saved rows.
- **A session only ends by finishing it.** Collapsing never discards it.
- **Warm-ups are never persisted** — they're suggestions, not history, so logging
  them can't distort volume or lifetime totals. They ride alongside the working
  sets and are excluded from every working-set aggregate (verdict, volume, set
  count). Warm-up rest is its own shorter interval, and the group carries a
  liability disclaimer.
- **A tap cycles differently for timed sets** — goal ⇄ untouched, since nobody
  taps a plank down a second at a time.
- **A missed set** is one that fell short on reps/seconds *or* weight (deloading
  to finish counts as a miss) — this feeds progression.
- **Finish order matters:** sets are saved *before* progression advances, so a
  template never steps up without the history to justify it.

## Where it lives

- State: `lib/state/active_workout.dart` (`SetEntry` / `ExerciseEntry` /
  `ActiveWorkout` + `ActiveWorkoutController`).
- Warm-up ramp: `lib/data/warmup.dart`.
- Screens/widgets: `lib/screens/workout_screen.dart`,
  `lib/widgets/resume_workout_bar.dart`.
